# System-wide_Atomic

A sample code which reproduces a erroneaous behavior of multi GeForce RTX-4090 systems.
This code produces non-deterministic results on multi 4090 systems, it runs correctly on single 4090 or on multi 3090 systems though.

My experience is limitted to docker ontainer environments ( I cannot afford my own multi-4090 system ) and the phenomena can be different when it run directly on a physical server.

I welcome feedbacks on this issue.
